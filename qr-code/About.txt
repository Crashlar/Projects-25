Development Philosophy & UI Design Approach
The project was built with a user-first mindset, prioritizing simplicity without sacrificing functionality. I aimed to create an intuitive interface where even first-time users could generate QR codes in seconds, while offering deeper customization through progressively disclosed options. By leveraging Streamlit's rapid prototyping capabilities, I structured the UI in clear sections: input, basic settings, and advanced controlsâ€”ensuring a natural flow from core functionality to specialized features. The design emphasizes visual feedback (real-time previews, color pickers) and smart defaults (auto-version detection, recommended settings) to reduce cognitive load. Complex features like animated QR codes were implemented with guardrails (frame limits, scannability checks) to maintain usability. The codebase follows a modular structure, separating UI components from QR generation logic, making it easy to maintain while keeping the interface lightweight and responsive.
